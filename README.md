# iReport

**Introduction**
The iReport app was borne out of the need to curb corruption. Its basic purpose is to alert the authorities and the general public to ill practices and other incidents that require attention. These incidents are broken down into two categories:

- Red-flags: corrupt practices

- Incidents: Other occurrences that require attention

**Basic Usage**
The app enables users to view all incidents reported. To add an incident, a user should create an account. Creating an account enables users to:

- Add an incident

- Edit an incident

- Delete an incident
